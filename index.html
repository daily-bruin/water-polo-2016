							<p>Perennial powerhouse USC enters the NCAA championships as the No. 1 seed, hoping to capture its 10th title in program history. The Trojans have been hot of late – knocking off No. 3 Cal, No. 6 Stanford and No. 2 UCLA in recent weeks. They haven't lost since the Mountain Pacific Invitational in late September.</p>

							<p>The team has succeeded in large part to its prolific offense, which currently leads the nation with 359 scores. Freshmen Matt Maier, Marin Dasic and Thomas Dunstan have combined for 67 goals. Furthermore, the Trojans have seven scorers with 20 or more goals this season.</p>

							<p>Junior goalkeeper and Rio 2016 Olympian McQuin Baron anchors the USC defense. Using his 6'9" frame and lengthy wingspan, he has let in an average of only 4.31 goals per game this season and collected a season high 17 saves against No. 2 UCLA in the MPSF Championship match.</p>

							<p>The key to defeating the Trojans lays in shutting down its top scorers. In its lone defeat this campaign to No. 3 California in late September, USC's top three goal scorers – Matteo Morelli and Blake and Lachlan Edwards – combined for only two goals.</p>

	  					<p>The UCLA men's water polo team will have the chance to win its third straight NCAA Championship this upcoming weekend. This would be the Bruins' 11th title and the third during coach Adam Wright's time at the helm of the program.</p>

	  					<p>The team reeled off 24 wins to begin the season, helping it set the NCAA record for consecutive wins with 57 straight victories. However, the Bruins fell twice to rival USC in the closing weeks of the campaign.</p>

	  					<p>With seven players with 20 scores or more on the season, the Bruin offense depends on no one player for the bulk of its goals. Two players to look out for are senior attackers Ryder Roberts and Patrick Fellner – the pair have a combined 11 goals in the past 3 matches.</p>

	  					<p>The defense, led by back to back MPSF Player of the Year Garrett Danner, has allowed six of fewer scores in 18 matches this year. The fifth-year goalie has averaged over 11 saves per game this year against Big 4 competition. </p>

	  					<p>The path to beating UCLA starts with beating its defense early – in the two Bruin losses this year, the opponents took multi-goal leads in the first half and each time entered halftime with the lead.</p>
